Understanding Smart Contract Vulnerabilities: Reentrancy, Integer Overflows, and Access Control Issues

Hi, I’m Oyiga Ifeanyichukwu Jude. As part of my learning journey into Web3 and cybersecurity, I’ve been exploring common smart contract vulnerabilities found in blockchain ecosystems like Ethereum.

This post is a summary of three major vulnerability types I’ve researched this week.

1. Reentrancy Attacks

What it is:
Reentrancy happens when a smart contract allows an external contract to call back into it before the first execution is complete.

Why it’s dangerous:
Attackers can repeatedly withdraw funds before the contract updates its balance, leading to huge losses.

Famous Example:
The DAO Hack of 2016, where attackers stole over $60 million worth of Ether by exploiting a reentrancy flaw.

How it can be prevented:

Using checks-effects-interactions patterns

Applying reentrancy guards like OpenZeppelin’s ReentrancyGuard

2. Integer Overflows and Underflows

What it is:
This happens when numeric variables exceed their maximum or minimum limits, causing unintended behavior.

Example scenario:
A user could trick a contract to reset their token balance by causing an overflow.

How to prevent it:

Using Solidity compiler versions ^0.8.0 and above, where overflow checks are automatic

Or using SafeMath libraries in older Solidity versions

3. Access Control Issues

What it is:
Poor access control allows unauthorized users to perform admin functions like minting tokens or pausing contracts.

Why it’s critical:
If functions like withdraw(), mint(), or upgradeContract() aren’t properly restricted, attackers can exploit them.

Prevention techniques:

Always use Solidity modifiers like onlyOwner

Follow the Principle of Least Privilege when designing contracts

Conclusion

Learning about these vulnerabilities has deepened my understanding of Web3 security risks and the importance of secure smart contract development.

I’m continuing my journey with hands-on labs on TryHackMe, reading SEAL’s public resources, and following real-world Ethereum security incidents.
