What I’ve Learned So Far About Web3 Security Threats: My Journey into Cybersecurity and Ethereum Ecosystem Security

My name is Oyiga Jude, and I’m currently in my final year studying Electronic and Computer Engineering. Over the past few weeks, I’ve started diving deep into the world of cybersecurity with a focus on Web3 and blockchain security.
Even though I’m still at the beginning of my journey, I’ve been learning from resources like Cisco’s Cybersecurity Essentials, TryHackMe, HackTheBox, and reading blog posts from organizations like The Security Alliance (SEAL).
Understanding Web3 Security Risks (From a Beginner’s Eyes)
In Web3, the threat landscape is vast and unique. Unlike traditional web applications, blockchain systems introduce new risks that developers and users need to consider.

Some of the key Web3-specific threats I’ve studied so far include:
1. Smart Contract Vulnerabilities
These are coding flaws in smart contracts deployed on blockchains like Ethereum.
Common examples I’ve read about include Reentrancy Attacks, Integer Overflows, and Unprotected Functions.
One example that stood out was the DAO hack of 2016, where attackers exploited a reentrancy vulnerability to drain millions in Ether.

2. Phishing and Social Engineering
Web3 users often rely on wallets like MetaMask.
Attackers create fake DApps or phishing websites that trick users into giving away private keys or approving malicious transactions.

3. Bridge Exploits
Cross-chain bridges are often targeted because they move large sums of assets between chains.
The Ronin Network Hack (March 2022) was one example, where attackers compromised validator nodes and stole over $600 million.

4. Frontend Vulnerabilities
Even with a secure smart contract, attackers can manipulate the frontend interface (the DApp UI) to deceive users into making unintended transactions.

My Personal Interest in Web3 Security
What excites me most about this field is the combination of cutting-edge technology and real-world impact. A small mistake in code or design can lead to millions of dollars in losses.
I’m particularly interested in learning more about:
Threat intelligence and incident response in Web3
Security auditing for smart contracts
Developing frameworks to help prevent and respond to attacks (like ETHSF from SEAL)

Why I Want to Join SEAL as an Intern
Applying for the Ethereum Season of Internships and specifically for SEAL’s roles (Security Frameworks Intern, Security Certification Intern, and Cybersecurity Analyst Intern) feels like the perfect next step for me.
Even though I’m new to this, I’m committed to learning fast, contributing actively, and growing with the community.
This writeup is my first small step toward that goal.

My Next Steps
Deepen my learning on Web3 security threats
Engage with SEAL’s GitHub projects
Continue practicing on platforms like TryHackMe and HackTheBox
Stay updated on major Web3 security incidents
